# Data



# Pretrained Model on HuggingFace ðŸ¤—
We release a [Concept and Named Entity Recognition model](https://huggingface.co/Babelscape/cner-base) trained on CNER-silver and on HigginFaceðŸ¤— Models.
Specifically, we fine-tuned DeBERTa-base for token classification model on our dataset.


# Reproduce Paper Results
The official weights and training scripts used for the paper are not released in this repository and can be released upon request. 
To produce results for the 10 trained models, run:
    ```
    bash test.sh
    ```
    
    `test.sh` also contains more complex bash for loops that can produce results on multiple datasets / models at once.

For a stronger system (DeBERTa + Bi-LSTM + CRF) look at [Reproduce Paper Results](#reproduce-paper-results) Section.
