# Description
This repository contains the evaluation scripts to evaluate CNER models and the official outputs of the CNER system, which can be used to reproduce paper results. We also release:
- Our silver training and gold evaluation data on [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/Babelscape/cner).
- A [Concept and Named Entity Recognition model](https://huggingface.co/Babelscape/cner-base) trained on CNER-silver and on HugginFaceðŸ¤— Models (see the [Tutorial Notebook](CNER_HuggingFace.ipynb)). Specifically, we fine-tuned a plain DeBERTa-base for token classification model on our dataset.


# Evaluate CNER models
Using the official data, it is possible to train a cner model on CNER-silver.

To evaluate a CNER model, it is possible to run the following:
    ```
    python scripts/evaluate.py --predictions_path path_to_predictions
    
    )
    ```
    
where `path_to_predictions` is a file with CNER prediction over the cner-gold dataset split.
Supported formats: .jsonl
    ```
sentence_id	tokens	c_vs_ne	predictions
55705165.21	['Commander', 'Donald', 'S.', ... '.'] ['NE', 'NE', 'NE', ... 'O']	['B-PER', 'I-PER', ... 'O']
    ```
    
Supported formats: .tsv

    ```


# Reproduce Paper Results
cner_output.jsonl are the official outputs of our cner system
To produce CNER results, it is possible to run the following:
    ```
    bash test.sh
    ```
