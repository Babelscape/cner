# Description
This repository contains the evaluation scripts to evaluate CNER models and the official outputs of the CNER system, which can be used to reproduce paper results. We also release:
- Our silver training and gold evaluation data on [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/Babelscape/cner).
- A [Concept and Named Entity Recognition model](https://huggingface.co/Babelscape/cner-base) trained on CNER-silver on the HugginFaceðŸ¤— Models hub. Specifically, we fine-tuned a pretrained DeBERTa-v3-base for token classification using the default hyperparameters, optimizer and architecture of huggingface (see the [Tutorial Notebook](CNER_HuggingFace.ipynb)) therefore the results of this model may differ from the ones presented in the paper.

# Setup

1. Clone the repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Babelscape/cner.git
    ```
2. Create a conda environment: 
    ```
    conda create -n env-name python==3.9
    ```
3. Install the requirements:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

# Evaluate CNER models

To evaluate a CNER model, run the following script:
    ```
    python scripts/evaluate.py --predictions_path path_to_predictions
    ```
    
where `path_to_predictions` is a file with CNER predictions over the CNER-gold dataset split.

Supported formats:

- .jsonl
    ```
  {"sentence_id": "55705165.21", "tokens": ["Commander", ..., "."],  "predictions": ["B-PER", ... , "O"]}
    ```
    
- .tsv

  | Sentence_id | Tokens | predictions |
  | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
  | "55705165.21"	| ['Commander', 'Donald', 'S.', ... '.'] | ['B-PER', 'I-PER', ... 'O'] |


# Reproduce Paper Results
At `outputs/cner_output.jsonl` you can find the official outputs of our CNER system.
To reproduce our CNER results, run the following script:
    ```
    python scripts/evaluate.py --predictions_path outputs/cner_output.jsonl
    ```
